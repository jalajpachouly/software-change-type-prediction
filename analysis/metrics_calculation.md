# Metrics Calculation

This document explains how we calculated the performance metrics presented in Tables 2 and 3 for our classification models on both unbalanced and balanced datasets. The metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for different machine learning models applied to software defect reports.

## Dataset Overview

We started with a dataset containing 2,003 software defect reports. Each report includes textual information about a software issue and a target label indicating the type of change (e.g., `changetype_jms`, `changetype_core`, etc.).

### Sample Data

The first few rows of the dataset are:

| Index | Report                                                                                                                  | Target          |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 0     | The issue with the JMS Inbound Endpoints revolves around JMS Provider specific configurations and their compatibility... | changetype_jms  |
| 1     | The new JMS Observability integration in Spring Boot aims to enhance monitoring capabilities for message-driven applications.| changetype_jms  |
| 2     | The discussion revolves around enhancing the `ChannelPublishingJmsMessageListener` to better handle concurrency issues... | changetype_jms  |
| 3     | The JMS InboundGateway currently lacks support for dynamic destination names, which limits flexibility in certain use cases. | changetype_jms  |
| 4     | The issue INT-2086 addresses inconsistencies in different JMS adapters, particularly in error handling and acknowledgment modes. | changetype_jms  |

### Checking for Missing Values

We ensured that there were no missing values in the dataset:

```python
Missing values in each column:
report    0
target    0
dtype: int64
```

### Class Distribution

The class distribution in the unbalanced dataset is as follows:

```python
Class distribution:
target
changetype_core       994
changetype_file       180
changetype_tcp_udp    154
changetype_build      144
changetype_jdbc       122
changetype_jms        120
changetype_redis      109
changetype_ftp         93
changetype_mail        87
Name: count, dtype: int64
```

As observed, the dataset is imbalanced, with `changetype_core` having significantly more instances than other classes.

## Data Preprocessing

### Text Cleaning

We performed data cleaning to preprocess the textual data:

- Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words.
- Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase.
- Stop Words Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to meaning (e.g., "the," "is").
- Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form.

Sample of original and cleaned text:

## Model Evaluation

We evaluated the performance of various classification models on both unbalanced and balanced datasets using 10-fold cross-validation.

### Cross-Validation Methodology

- **10-Fold Cross-Validation**: The dataset was split into 10 equal parts. Each model was trained on 9 parts and tested on the remaining part. This process was repeated 10 times, with each part serving as the test set once.
- **Metrics Computed**: For each fold, we computed the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The average over all folds was reported.

## Performance Metrics Calculation

### Definitions of Metrics

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions over total predictions.
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}}
  \]
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positives over all positive predictions.
  \[
  \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Positives}}
  \]
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positives over all actual positives.
  \[
  \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Negatives}}
  \]
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
  \[
  \text{F1-Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision + Recall}}
  \]

### Models Evaluated

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (NB)**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**

### Calculations on Unbalanced Data

For each model, we performed 10-fold cross-validation and calculated the average metrics.

changetype_build       0.88      0.76      0.81        29
...
```

- **We computed the weighted average of Precision, Recall, and F1-Score across all classes to account for class imbalance.** The weighted averages were:

  - **Precision**: **0.86**
  - **Recall**: **0.85**
  - **F1-Score**: **0.85**

- Training over 4 epochs with performance stabilizing.
- **Accuracy**: Best observed accuracy was **0.88**.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: From the classification report at the best epoch (Epoch 2):

```plaintext
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

changetype_build       0.92      0.83      0.87        29
...
weighted avg       0.89      0.88      0.88       401
```

- **Weighted averages were:**

  - **Precision**: **0.88**

## Explanation of Improvements

Balancing the dataset resulted in improved performance metrics across most models:

- **Accuracy** increased for all models on the balanced dataset.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score** improved due to the models being able to learn from a more representative sample of each class.

Specifically:

- **Multinomial NB** saw a significant increase in accuracy from **0.50** to **0.72**, indicating that balancing the data helped mitigate the impact of class imbalance on this model.

- **BERT** showed the highest accuracy and balanced performance metrics on both datasets, but improved further on the balanced dataset.

## Conclusion

Through careful preprocessing, balancing of the dataset, and evaluation, we computed the performance metrics for various classification models. The calculations were based on cross-validation results and, in the case of BERT, validation on a separate set after each training epoch. Balancing the dataset notably improved the models' abilities to generalize and perform accurately across all classes, as evidenced by the metrics.

### Note on Metric Computations

- **Cross-Validation Metrics**: For each fold, we calculated the metrics and then averaged them across all folds.
- **Weighted Averages**: For multiclass classification, we used weighted averages to account for the support (number of instances) of each class.
- **Classification Reports**: Provided by scikit-learn's `classification_report` function and Hugging Face's transformers library for BERT.

### References to Output Logs

- The output logs confirm the training processes and validation performance, particularly for the BERT model.
- The classification reports after each epoch for BERT show the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class and the weighted averages reported.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce these results:

1. **Preprocess the Data**: Follow the text cleaning steps outlined.
2. **Balance the Dataset**: Use oversampling techniques for minority classes.
3. **Train Models**: Use 10-fold cross-validation for traditional machine learning models.
4. **Train BERT**: Fine-tune the BERT model for several epochs, validating after each epoch.
5. **Compute Metrics**: Use appropriate functions to compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

By following these steps, the performance metrics can be calculated as demonstrated in Tables 2 and 3.
